You are a professional software security researcher and your task is to fix the build error in the following fuzz target.
<fuzz target>
{CODE_TO_BE_FIXED}
</fuzz target>

<error>
{ERROR_MESSAGES}
</error>

The project-under-test is {PROJECT}, the repo has been cloned into <code>/src/{PROJECT}/</code>
The fuzz target is at <code>{FUZZ_TARGET_PATH}</code>, and the script to build the project and the fuzz target is at <code>/src/build.sh</code>.
You have full bash access to everything in the build environment, including all source code, environment variables, and others.

Your task is to iteratively respond me with ONE bash command to investigate and fix the build error, and I will provide you with the output of the command.
If the output is empty, I will response with a single space.
Some rules:
1. One command at a time.
2. If the bash command has no output, I will reply with a single empty space.
3. Each response your send should first explain the reason why you want to run the command wrapped by <reason></reason>, then provide the command to run wrapped in <bash></bash> in this format:
<reason>
Reasons here.
</reason>
<bash>
One bash command here.
</bash>
3. There are other fuzz targets under <code>/src/{PROJECT}/</code>, use them as examples when investigating how to fix the fuzz target above.
4. You are allowed to modify the fuzz target at <code>{FUZZ_TARGET_PATH}</code> or the build script at <code>/src/build.sh</code> ONLY. You MUST not modify an other files.
5. Analyze the fuzz target first, the error is most likely here. minimize headers as some headers may be unnecessary.
6. It might be in <code>/src/build.sh</code>, but are NEVER in other files.
6. If you need to modify the <code>/src/build.sh<code>, also provide me with command to modify the script.
7. The final goal is to answer two questions about the build error: a) What caused the crash? b) What is the fixed the crash?
8. If you have a conclusion on how to fix the fuzz target, output it wrapped by <conclusion></conclusion> followed by the fixed target wrapped in <fuzz target></fuzz target> and the command to replace the old fuzz target with it wrapped in <bash></bash>:
<conclusion>
Reasons here.
</conclusion>
<fuzz target>
The full code of fixed fuzz target here.
</fuzz target>
<bash>
One bash script to replace the old fuzz target with the fixed fuzz target.
</bash>
9. If you have a conclusion on how to modify the build script, output it wrapped by <conclusion></conclusion> followed by the command to modify the build script<build script></build script>:
<conclusion>
Reasons here.
</conclusion>
<build script>
One bash command here.
</build script>
10. DO NOT attempt to build the fuzz target. STOP once you think the errors are fixed. I will recompile by myself.
11. Ensure the fuzz target thoroughly tested the function-under-test <code>void absl::str_format_internal::(anonymous namespace)::BinaryToDecimal::operator()(const void *, Span<unsigned int>)</code>.
